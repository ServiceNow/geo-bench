## Pre-commit hooks

In order to ensure code quality, we provide a set of pre-commit hooks that can be run before comitting. These hooks are a bunch of checks that will be run before each commit. To install them, simply `pip install pre-commit` and run `pre-commit install` in your local copy of the repository.
